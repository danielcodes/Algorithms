# Algorithms

Programming assignments for my algorithms class

Numero Uno
-Implement insertion sort with both shift and swap and show that swap is more efficient

Numero Dos
-Implement a function that takes in a directed graph (2D array), with it's containing values (another array), computes the aggregate values of each vertex and sort.
Return an array with the sorted indices, not values.

Numero Tres
-Create a hybrid algorithm that fuses insertion and merge. Through trial and error, find the N value for which insertion sort is faster than merge (use nanotime). Then merge's base case occurs when N drops below the found value.

Numero Cuatro
-TBA
